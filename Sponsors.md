## Devfolio 🤝 Replit
As part of [Devfolio's University Season Program](https://nsb.dev/community-tier), Replit sponsors all Devfolio Community Hackathons with bounties and schwags!

- $50 to winning project of the hackathon (must be deployed on Replit)
- Replit schwags to 5 eligible submissions deployed on Replit.
- Eligibility for internship / full time role interviews at Replit

# ✅ Submission Guidelines

- A submission with a functioning Replit link can be defined as valid.
- **Submit the Replit link of your publicly visible source code** of the hack on Devfolio. Broken links will disqualify the project from the judging process. Find the steps [here](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/github-and-run-button).
- There must be **a clear description of the working of the hack** in the README file. If the hack is live and can be tested on Replit, add the relevant links to that in the README file too.
- Create a **short video demo** on Devfolio itself while making the submission. Make sure that the person watching the video is fully able to understand what the bot does and what its functionalities are.
- Make sure you've mentioned `Replit` in the `Technologies Used` section and **selected the appropriate track** while submitting the project.

# 📝 Judging

The judging will be done by the Replit team based on submissions on Devfolio, post the hackathon. Awarding the prize will be at the Replit team's discretion and subject to the hacks meeting a minimum bar of quality. Prizes will be announced and disbursed within a couple of days after the hackathon.

### Judging Criteria

The judges grade submissions across five equally-weighted categories:

- **Design:** Is it easy to use? Does the visual design delight you? If targeting developers, is the experience smooth and intuitive?
- **Novelty/Originality:** Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way?
- **Technical Accomplishment:** Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete?
- **Potential Impact:** Does it fill a gap in the universe, and have the potential to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience or market?
- **Creativity/Fun:** Is it creative and put a smile on people’s faces?
